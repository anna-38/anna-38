### Hi there 👋

I am Anna Nava, from Lecco (Italy).

- 🔎 In my job, I search for contaminants in food to guarantee its safety. Artificial Neural Networks are my first allies in this mission.
- 👩‍🎓 I have a **Bachelor degree in Mathematics** and on the 20th of October 2022, I graduated in **Data Science** at the University of Milan-Bicocca.
- 🇦🇹 I attended the Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt as an Erasmus student in 2021.
- ⛺ I'm in love with multi-day trekkings. Recently, I've also finished a rock climbing course and I'll be enthusiastic to share an adventure or my previous experiences information with you if you are interested. Next goal for this August: Alta Via n2 in Dolomiti, two weeks between Bressanone and Feltre.
- 🎲 From time to time, I travel around Varia as a Fire Genasi trying to resolve the mistery of Black Rain.
- :house: I've just moved in with my boyfriend: still managing not to set the house on fire.
- :open_book: Particularly during my daily commute, I love reading. Open to any suggestions, I also really appreciate comics. One of my favorite is **Palestine** by Joe Sacco.
